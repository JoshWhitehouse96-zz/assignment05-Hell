    <p class="lead">Nothing beats a long walk with your four-legged friend on a fresh, spring morning. Or seeing the joy on their faces when you pick up a ball and they know it’s playtime in the local park! Even relaxing at home feels better in each other’s company. There’s an old saying, which is certainly true, that pets and dogs repay the love you give them ten-fold. Before you rush out and get a dog, it’s important to think it through very thoroughly. It can be hard work and it’s a lifetime commitment, as your dog will be relying on you for many years to come. Once you’re sure you have the time and lifestyle to include a dog in your life, and you’ve done your research about different breeds and personalities it’s time to look at all the benefits of owning a dog.</p>
